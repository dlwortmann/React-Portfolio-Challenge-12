## Description
This was the first project I built from scratch using vite. It was developed to present projects and applications that I worked on in the bootcamp course to potenial employers, clients and fellow developers to demonstrate my knowledge. I used React to build the application and styled it with Material UI. I then deployed the application using Netlify.

My tutor Charlie assisted in working out some of the syntax errors I was getting when trying to run the add role and employee commands. The Xpert Learning Assistant on BootCampSpot was able to suggest solutions to some bugs within the update employee role command.
